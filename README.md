Introduction
In this project, we simulate Pokémon battles between a Trainer and a chosen opponent from their team. The battles are turn-based, where each Pokémon can use moves that belong to different categories (Physical, Special, Status) and have specific effects.

Features
Pokémon and Moves: Implemented several Pokémon and moves with different types, powers, accuracies, and effects (e.g., damage, status effects).
Trainer Interaction: Allows a Trainer to select a Pokémon from their team to battle against another randomly chosen opponent.
Battle System: Simulates battles where each Pokémon takes turns selecting moves until one Pokémon's health drops to zero.
